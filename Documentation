1. PYTHON HEARTY HEART PROJECT

  2. What is the purpose of your project? Tell about your project
The purpose of my project is to create a heart shaped curve using Pythons turtle graphics. Equation used in the heart(k) and heartb(k) functions are parametric equations in the heart shape. 
The equations define the x and y coordinates of the heart in terms of k and the goto ( ) function moves the turtle to the computed coordinates
The bgcolor ("black") sets the background color. A red heart shape drawn on a black background.

  3.  How your program works? Explain how to run your program.
The funcion calculate the x and y coordinates of the heart shape, the input k varies over a range of values and hearta(k) control the horizontal(x) position
while heartb(k) controls the vertical (y) position. The loop runs and computing new (x, y) moves the turtle to that position, effectively plotting the heart hape.
